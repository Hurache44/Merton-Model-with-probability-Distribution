# Merton-Model-with-probability-Distribution
The model inherits an extension of the Merton OU Model, I already uploaded. It supervises the asset beta, Sharpe ratio and a quota probability with regime switch. Indicating a more precise approach to estimate current outcomes of returns, the model estimates a regression fit for a backward looking time series and estimation of the fit (R^2).
